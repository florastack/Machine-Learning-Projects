I had same issue with what was discussed in 
https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/when-i-try-to-run-my-python-code-it-says-that-python-isnt-an-operable-program/21722
when I first installed Sublime on my windows based computer.

How I fixed it is: 

In windows, Start - edit the system environment variables - path and add the path of Python.exe 

Then, in Sublime, Tools- Build Systems-New Build System, put the following lines,

{
"cmd": ["python", "-u", "$file"],
"file_regex": "^ ]File \"(...?)\", line ([0-9]*)",
"selector": "source.python"
}

Save the file with name 'Python3.sublime-build'
